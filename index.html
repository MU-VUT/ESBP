                        European Symposium on Biopolymer (ESBP) is a traditional and successful series of symposia
                        dedicated to all the aspects of biopolymers – an outstanding category of materials that includes
                        polyesters, polysaccharides, polyamides, polyphosphates but also other polymeric materials of
                        natural origin. The ambition of the series is to gather experts from very versatile fields such
                        as molecular biology or biotechnology but also from material science and processing to share
                        their knowledge, experience, and also opinions on all the aspects related to biopolymers and
                        drive the field of biopolymer science further. In addition, the ambition of the conference is
                        also to provide a platform to bring closer academy and industry.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The symposium series was launched in 1999 in XXX. So far, the last event within the series- the
                        10th ESBP was held in Straubing in 2019. After that, the regular interval between the symposia
                        was ruined by the COVID pandemic. However, now it is pleasure for us to inform you that 11th
                        ESBP will be organized from 13-15.9.2023 in Brno, the Czech Republic by the Faculty of
                        Chemistry, Brno University of Technology.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <b>The main topics</b> of the conference will include:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Production, isolation, and purification of biopolymers</li>
                        <li>Processing and characterization of biopolymers
                        </li>
                        <li>iopolymers for medicine and tissue engineering
                        </li>
                        <li>Biopolymers in high-value and technical applications
                        </li>
                        <li>Synthetic biology for biopolymer engineering and production
                        </li>
                        <li>Biodegradation, ecology, biology and environmental impact of biopolymers
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        So, if you are, for any reason, interested in biopolymers and if you would like to meet experts
                        in this exciting field of science and technology, we are looking forward to hosting you in Brno
                        in September 2023.
                    </p>
